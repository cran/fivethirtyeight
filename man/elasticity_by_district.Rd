}
\note{
The original dataset only has 2 columns: "district" and "elasticity". I separated  the "district" columns into two.
For example, in row 1 of the dataset, the original "district" = "MI-5", and I separated it into â€œstate" = "Michigan" and "district_number" = "5".
In addition, I used the full names for all states instead of abbreviations.
