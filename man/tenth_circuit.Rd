\note{
In immigration cases, partial relief to immigration petitioner is coded as liberal because the petitioner typically seeks just one core remedy (e.g., withholding of removal, adjustment of status, or asylum); in discrimination cases, partial relief is coded as multiple issues because the plaintiff often seeks separate remedies under multiple claims (e.g., disparate treatment, retaliation, etc.) and different sources of law.
