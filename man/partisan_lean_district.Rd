forecasts.

\note{
The original dataset only has 2 columns: "district" and "pvi_538". I separated each of the 2 columns into two.
For example, in row 1 of the dataset, the original "district" = "AK-1", and I separated it into "state" = "Arkansas" and "district_number" = "1";
the original "pvi_538" = "R+15.21", and I separated it into â€œpvi_party" = "R" and "pvi_amount" = "15.21".
In addition, I used the full names for all states instead of abbreviations.
