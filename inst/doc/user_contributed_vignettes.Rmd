Due to CRAN space limitations on packages, user-contributed vignettes that walk through different analyses using the data sets in the `fivethirtyeight` package are linked below in this "vignette of vignettes." You can find both the R Markdown file needed to generate the file and also a link to the HTML vignette on the package website at <https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.com>. The vignette title links to the HTML version and the (Rmd) immediately following links to the R Markdown source. We encourage others to share their analyses using the `fivethirtyeight` data sets.

The developmental version of the package stored on GitHub contains all of the vignettes so if you'd like to build the package locally, first install the [`remotes` package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes) and then install the package via

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
