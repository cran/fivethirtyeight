#' The dataset includes the cities with the 75 largest police forces, with the exception of Honolulu for which data is not available. All calculations are based on data from the U.S. Census.
#'
#' The Census Bureau numbers are potentially going to differ from other counts for three reasons:
#' \enumerate{
#'    \item The census category for police officers also includes sheriffs, transit police and others who might not be under the same jurisdiction as a city's police department proper. The census category won't include private security officers.
#'    \item The census data is estimated from 2006 to 2010; police forces may have changed in size since then.
#'    \item There is always a margin of error in census numbers; they are estimates, not complete counts.
#' }
#'
#' Note: Missing values means that there are fewer than 100 police officers of that race serving that city.

#' @note In immigration cases, partial relief to immigration petitioner is coded as liberal because the petitioner typically seeks just one core remedy (e.g., withholding of removal, adjustment of status, or asylum); in discrimination cases, partial relief is coded as multiple issues because the plaintiff often seeks separate remedies under multiple claims (e.g., disparate treatment, retaliation, etc.) and different sources of law.
