#' (starts with "R"). Eliminations supersede roses. "E" connotes a standard
#' elimination, typically at a rose ceremony. "EQ" means the contestant quits.
#' "EF" means the contestant was fired by production. "ED" connotes a date
#' elimination. "EU" connotes an unscheduled elimination, one that takes place
#' at a time outside of a date or rose ceremony. "R" means the contestant
#' received a rose. "R1" means the contestant got a first impression rose.
#' "D1" means a one-on-one date, "D2" means a 2-on-1, "D3" means a 3-on-1

#' ceremonies, and may not line up exactly with episodes.
